### Diversity in Tech:

### Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago:
- Women  have  always  played  an  important  role  in  Computer  Science  findings,  but  their importance has always been overshadowed by men. Nowadays, men outnumber women by 3 times on computing occupations in the US, but still women prove to be essential on the development of technological fields. This work intends to place women at the forefront of computer science’s history.  In order to demonstrate that their work was  essential for  the development of current technologies, a broad historical overview is given. This overview is chronologically  and  thematically  structured  in  several  periods,  from  the  early  computer machines (before 1900) to our current digital society (after 2010). Finally, an outlook on the role of  women in  computing is given.  A detailed discussion  of individual  contributions by women  would  go beyond  the scope  of this  work.  Nor  can  a  sociological  analysis of  the reasons for the gender gap be provided. Nevertheless, the work wants to be more than a mere quantitative enumeration of women’s contributions to computer sciences. The essay wants to plea for the integration of these women in the literature, i.e., in the historiography of computer sciences, which requires to reconsider the self-image of this discipline.

### Why diversity matters to your tech company:
